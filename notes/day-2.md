# The Begginings of a Mini-Framework

I have the start of a simple Component and App classes. They interface
and work with glimmer just fine, and soon I will have the components
and the app load thier templates from files. However, I have not done
event handling yet.

I am currently hitchiking on Glimmer's build setup for now by keeping
my working files in the `glimmer/packages/glimmer-demos/using-app/`
folder, but before every commit I copy everything out to the main
directory for when my ember-cli (I'm also thinking about switching to
just Broccili) setup is ready.
